Hi, Iâ€™m an incoming Masters in Robotics student at Carnegie Mellon University. Previously, I received my undergraduate degree from IIT (ISM) Dhanbad, India.

I am broadly interested in building general purpose robots that can adapt to new tasks and environments.


<!-- Hello! I'm a passionate researcher, obsessed with Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, as I firmly believe that they possess the transformative power to redefine the world around us and enhance our comprehension of it. I aim to build a beautiful and efficient system that is capable of understanding itself, others and its surroundings, ultimately contributing positively to societal harmony and progress.

My research interests are multifaceted, yet I find profound fascination in embodied AI, cognitive neuroscience and legged robot locomotion. I am currently exploring the depths of embodied intelligence, understanding the intricate interplay between Attention, Cognition, Perception, and Action in robotic systems. -->
